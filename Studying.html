                        <p>If you choose your school, you have to be eligible for studying in Vancouver by getting a student permit. It typically
                        <span style="background:yellow">takes 2–3 business week </span> to get a Canadian visitor visa.
                            <blockquote cite="https://www.canada.ca/en.html" >
                            It is a two step process: 
                            Apply online on CIC website by filling up forms, uploading supporting documents and paying the fees. Within next 1-3 weeks, CIC will evaluate your application details and make a decision. Although you can check online how long it is taking on average to process study permits, it is always a good idea to apply as early as possible, and at least four to six months prior to the start of classes.
                            
                            You can apply for a Canadian study permit either online or through a paper application, which can be obtained from the Citizenship and Immigration Canada(CIC) website. Paper applications typically take about twice as long, and it's always recommended to check the processing times well in advance.
                            
                            When you arrive in Canada, a Government of Canada officer will meet you.
                            The officer will ask to see <span style="background:yellow">your passport or travel documents</span>.<strong>Make sure that you have them with you.</strong>
                            Even if you don’t need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) or a visa to enter Canada, the officer will ask you a few questions. They will make sure you meet the requirements to enter Canada.
                            You will also have to show the officer that you will leave Canada at the end of your stay.
